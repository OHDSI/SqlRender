SqlRender
=========

Introduction
============
This is an R package for rendering parameterized SQL, and translating it to different SQL dialects. 

Features
========
- Supports a simple markup syntax for making SQL parameterized, and renders parameterized SQL (containing the markup syntax) to executable SQL
- The syntax supports defining default parameter values
- The syntax supports if-then-else structures
- Has functions for translating SQL from one dialect (Microsoft SQL Server) to other dialects (Oracle, PostgreSQL, Amazon RedShift, Netezza)
- The Java library used in this package can also be used as a stand-alone library in Java applications.

Examples
========
This exampe shows the use of parameters, as well as SqlRender's {if} ? {then} : {else} syntax:

```r
sql <- renderSql("SELECT * FROM @a; {@b != ''}?{USE @b;}", a = "my_table", b = "my_schema")$sql
```

will produce the variable `sql` containing this value: 

```
"SELECT * FROM my_table; USE my_schema;"
```

subsequently running this code

```r
sql <- translateSql(sql, "sql server", "oracle")$sql
```

will produce the variable `sql` containing this value: 

```
"SELECT * FROM my_table; ALTER SESSION SET current_schema =  my_schema;"
```

Technology
============
SqlRender is an R package wrapped around a Java library. The rJava package is used as interface. 

System Requirements
===================
Requires R with the package rJava installed. Also requires Java 1.6 or higher.

Dependencies
